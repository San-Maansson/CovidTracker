## CovidTracker

The primary focus is to practice and use SQL queries and the end goal of this project is to prepare Covid related data for data visualization. SQL queries on this depository were created via MS SQL Server Management Studio as an exercise.

- The dataset was downloaded from [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths] as a CSV file and subsequently edited via Excel

- Only data from China, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Denmark and the US were kept while records for all other countries were removed. 
Other minor cleaning and adjustments were made.

- 2 Tables were saved, CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations, as excel files.

- Based on these 2 files, a new database with 2 tables were later created in SQL Server for further manipulation

- The SQL queries that were used were later uploaded to this project folder.
